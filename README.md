A skill for Amazon Alexa. 
You can ask rules for FantasyFlight Games's game KeyForge, and it will read from the official rulebook (version from 17 Jan 19). 


Official rules can be found here: https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/keyforge/ , I do not own anything related to KeyForge, this app simply references the official rulebook, which can be downloaded in PDF form from the link I quoted.
